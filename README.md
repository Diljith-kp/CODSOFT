|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 🔢 `01`     | **Movie Genre Classification** | Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings can be used with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. | 🚧 In Progress |
| 📝 `02`     | **Credit Card Fraud Detection** | Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This involves using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions and experimenting with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ⏳ To Do     |
| 💡 `03`     | **Customer Churn Prediction** | Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. This will utilize historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ⏳ To Do     |
